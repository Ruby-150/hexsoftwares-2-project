📌 Project Title

Customer Segmentation using Clustering (Mall Customers Dataset)

🔍 Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques (K-Means & DBSCAN) on the Mall Customer Segmentation Data. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on age, income, and spending habits to enable targeted marketing strategies.

✨ Key Features
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized distributions of age, income, and spending scores
✔ K-Means Clustering – Identified 5 optimal customer segments using the Elbow Method
✔ DBSCAN Clustering – Detected outliers and density-based clusters
✔ 3D Interactive Visualization – Used Plotly for dynamic cluster exploration
✔ Business Insights – Interpreted clusters for marketing strategies
